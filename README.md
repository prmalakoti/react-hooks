# Getting Started with Create React App

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Hooks

Hooks are built-in React functions that allow you to use React features in functional components.

useState: `useState` is a React Hook that lets you add state to functional components.

State:`State` is a way to store and manage data within a component â€” like variables that can change over time and cause the UI to update.

useEffect: `useEffect` is used to perform side effects in our components.
